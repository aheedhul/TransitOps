# TransitOps - Smart Transport Operations Platform

**Hackathon Project | 8 Hours | 5-Persona Fleet ERP**

> A centralized platform that digitizes vehicle management, driver assignment, trip dispatch, maintenance tracking, fuel logging, expense management, and operational analytics   replacing spreadsheets and manual logbooks.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```powershell
pnpm install
cd apps/api && npx tsx src/main.ts    # Terminal 1   API on :8080
cd apps/web && npx vite                # Terminal 2   Web on :5173
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**   login with:

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | `admin@transitops.demo` | `TransitOps@123` |
| Fleet Manager | `fleet_manager@transitops.demo` | `Demo@123` |
| Driver | `driver@transitops.demo` | `Demo@123` |
| Safety Officer | `safety_officer@transitops.demo` | `Demo@123` |
| Financial Analyst | `financial_analyst@transitops.demo` | `Demo@123` |

**Each role sees only their authorized screens**   login as different users to test RBAC.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
apps/web (Vite + React 19 + TanStack Router + Tailwind)
    │
    ├── /api/v1/* → Express API (Node 22 + TypeScript)
    │                   │
    │                   ├── Drizzle ORM → Supabase PostgreSQL 16
    │                   ├── Redis (queue/cache/pub-sub)
    │                   └── Event Bus (in-process pub/sub)

    └── Dexie IndexedDB (offline store + outbox queue)
```

**Backend modules** (each with DTO/Repository/Service/Routes/Rules layers):
auth, vehicles, drivers, customers, trips, intelligence, maintenance,
fuel, expenses, notifications, sync, reports, telematics, geofences

**Frontend features**: auth store (Zustand), API client, offline engine,
fleet map, copilot, command palette, notification bell, dark mode

## 🔐 Business Rules (Server-Enforced)

| Rule | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| Registration number unique per org | DB unique constraint |
| Retired/In-Shop vehicles excluded from dispatch | `validateDispatch()` rules chain |
| Expired license drivers cannot be assigned | Rules chain   `driver.license_valid` |
| Suspended drivers blocked | Rules chain   `driver.not_suspended` |
| Cargo weight ≤ vehicle capacity | Rules chain   `cargo.within_capacity` |
| Dispatch flips vehicle+driver to On-Trip | Transactional service with events |
| Complete trip restores to Available | `trip.complete` → status flip |
| Cancel restores to Available | `trip.cancel` → status flip |
| Maintenance auto-flips to In-Shop | `maintenance.create` → vehicle status update |
| Close maintenance restores to Available | `maintenance.close` → vehicle status update |

All rules are pure functions in `modules/<x>/rules.ts`   unit-testable.

## 📊 Database (25+ tables)

Organizations, Users, RefreshTokens, AuditLogs, Vehicles, Drivers,
Customers, Trips, TripEvents, MaintenanceLogs, MaintenanceSchedules,
FuelLogs, FuelAnomalyFlags, Expenses, Notifications, NotificationRecipients,
VehicleDocuments, VehicleLocations, Geofences, GeofenceEvents,
VehicleHealthScores, DriverScoreHistory, EmissionsRecords,
EmissionsFactors, Settings, SyncIdempotency

All tables use UUID primary keys, soft deletes, `organization_id` for multi-tenancy.

## 🧪 Demo Workflow (5 minutes)

1. **Login as admin** → Dashboard shows 12 vehicles, 4 KPIs
2. **Vehicles** → See all 12 vehicles with status colors
3. **Drivers** → 8 drivers with license expiry dates
4. **Trips** → Create → Dispatch (rule chain validates) → View timeline
5. **Reports** → Fleet KPIs, Financial, ESG/CO2, Utilization heatmap
6. **Fleet Map** → 11 vehicle dots across Bangalore
7. **Audit Log** → Every action recorded with actor/entity/timestamp
8. **Toggle dark mode** in sidebar header
9. **Login as driver** → Only sees Dashboard, Vehicles, Trips   sidebar limited

## 🔑 Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. Required: `DATABASE_URL` (Supabase connection string). All other keys (LLM, Maps, Push) are optional   the system degrades gracefully without them.
